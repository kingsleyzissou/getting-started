# Getting started with `osbuild`

The `osbuild` system is a group of applications, APIs, specifications, and
implementations to build images of Linux operating systems in an isolated
and reliable way. Ready to be deployed to your favorite cloud provider,
private hypervisor, or disk-media.

## Ecosystem

Tasks are split out across a multitude of tools, here's a quick rundown
of what each of them does.

### osbuild

At the core of the project is the [osbuild](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild)
project. This provides the build pipelines.

### osbuild-composer

[osbuild-composer](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer) is the higher
level translation layer between front end tools and `osbuild`. It provides APIs
that can be used by web-frontends, cli-tools, and provides `osbuild` workers
that perform the build pipelines.

### composer-cli

The [composer-cli](https://github.com/osbuild/weldr-client) (called
`weldr-client` for historical reasons). Is one of the clients for
`osbuild-composer`. It provides a command line interface to the exposed APIs.

### image-builder

This is the console.redhat.com HTTP API that speaks to `osbuild-composer` and
translates it for the `image-builder-frontend`.

### image-builder-frontend

The frontend for console.redhat.com, it gets data from `image-builder`.

## Quickstart

`osbuild-getting-started` tries to make it as easy as possible to both build
RPMs of anything in the `osbuild` ecosystem as to run it (after you've built it).

You should be all set with the following which drops you into the
`composer-cli` where you can build an image or play around:

```
[root@desktopa osbuild-getting-started]# make setup-host
# ...
[root@desktopa osbuild-getting-started]# make run

```

## Build

Docker is used to build the RPMs, to get started make sure your host system
has Docker on it (you can set this up through ``sudo make setup-host``).

When the host system is set up it is time to build some RPMs, the steps are
two-fold where a build container is created which we then later use to perform
the build in. This allows you to inspect the build environment (but you don't
*have* to).

By default `osbuild-getting-started` gets the latest tags from the upstream
repositories but these can be overridden:


```
make build/osbuild osbuild_version=v55
make rpms/osbuild osbuild_version=v55
```

The first incantation will check out the `v55` tag for `osbuild` and create a
container with all build requirements satisfied. The second command will build
the RPMs, these are available in `./build/rpms` afterwards. Note that the first
is a dependency of the second.

```
â‚¬ ls ./build/rpms/
osbuild-55-1.20220505git090f768.fc36.noarch.rpm
python3-osbuild-55-1.20220505git090f768.fc36.noarch.rpm
```

Building for different versions is done by passing a different version to the
Makefile. If you want to build the `main` branch you can leave out the version
argument.

To build other things from the ecosystem the format is the same:

```
make rpms/osbuild-composer osbuild_composer_version=v51
make rpms/weldr-client weldr_client_version=v35
```

## Run

If you've built at least `osbuild` and `osbuild-composer` and their RPMs it's time
to get things up and running.
